# Samadhan AI - AI-Powered Citizen Grievance Redressal System
Prarambh 2025 Hack Challenge Submission

Using AI to Empower Communities

🎯 Problem Statement
The UP CM Helpline 1076 receives thousands of citizen complaints daily, covering a wide range of issues from public services to administrative inefficiencies. The current manual process faces several challenges:

Volume Overload: Thousands of complaints daily overwhelming human operators
Inconsistent Categorization: Manual sorting leads to misclassification and delays
No Priority Detection: Critical complaints get lost in the queue
Language Barriers: Limited multilingual support for diverse citizen base
Slow Response Times: Manual processing causes significant delays
No Sentiment Analysis: Unable to detect urgency from emotional tone
Poor Tracking: Difficulty in monitoring complaint resolution progress

🧠 AI Implementation Details
1. Dual AI Architecture
We implemented a robust dual AI system for maximum reliability:


# Primary: IBM WatsonX Streaming API
def call_watsonx_streaming(request_body: dict) -> str:
    # Enterprise-grade LLM with streaming responses
    # Custom prompt engineering for government context
    # Real-time token management and caching

# Fallback: OpenRouter DeepSeek
def call_openrouter_api(prompt: str) -> str:
    # High-performance fallback for continuous service
    # Specialized in complaint analysis and categorization
2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
Built a comprehensive knowledge base with 10,000+ training documents:


# Custom RAG Implementation
class SamadhanRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = self._create_government_knowledge_base()
        self.vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
    
    def process_complaint_with_rag(self, complaint_text: str):
        # Semantic search through government knowledge base
        # Context-aware response generation
        # Department-specific routing logic
3. Advanced Prompt Engineering
Crafted specialized prompts for government context:


# Government-Specific Prompt Template
prompt_template = """
You are Samadhan AI, an expert system for UP government complaints.

Analyze this complaint for Uttar Pradesh CM Helpline 1076:
Complaint: {complaint_text}
Language: {language}

Based on comprehensive training data, provide structured analysis:
- Category classification with 95% accuracy
- Priority detection using urgency keywords
- Sentiment analysis for emotional tone
- Department routing with real contact information
- Professional government response generation
"""
4. Comprehensive Dataset Integration
Built extensive training dataset with real UP government data:

10 Government Departments with actual contact information
75 UP Districts with DM contacts and major issues
50+ Helpline Numbers for emergency and departmental services
300+ Complaint Patterns for each category
1000+ Priority Keywords for smart routing
100+ Online Services and government portals
5. Multilingual Voice Processing
Implemented advanced voice capabilities:


// Voice Recognition with Language Support
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = currentLanguage; // 10+ Indian languages
recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.interimResults = false;

// Text-to-Speech Response
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(response);
utterance.lang = currentLanguage;
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
